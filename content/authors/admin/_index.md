I am a PhD student in Computer Science at University of California, Berkeley, advised by [Prof. Alvin Cheung](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~akcheung/). I was also advised by [Prof. Dawn Song](https://dawnsong.io/) at UC Berkeley. Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Peking University, China, advised by [Prof. Liwei Wang](http://www.liweiwang-pku.com/) and [Prof. Di He](https://dihe-pku.github.io/).

I specialize in Artificial Intelligence (AI) with a focus on Large Language Models (LLMs). My research includes pretraining, prompting, and evaluation methodologies for a variety of language models, including BERT, T5, and GPT-like LLMs. My recent research delves into leveraging LLMs for code generation, infilling, transpilation, and understanding, pushing the boundaries of how AI interacts with programming languages.
